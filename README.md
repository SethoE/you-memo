## About You-Memo

This is a website build with Laravel.
You-Memo is a website which helps you to memorize things. Due to its use of the learning method space-repetition", it's a lot more efficient than traditional study methods. You can either greatly decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the amount you learn. The simplicity of learning and repeating what've you learned makes You-Memo easily accessible to anyone. You-Memo gives its users the ability to create their own custom decks. Since it is content-agnostic, meaning it supports text, images, audio and video, users are thereby unbound by any restrictions and have a lot of freedom and possibilities for creating their own deck.

For example:
- Learning a language
- Studying for medical and law exams
- Memorizing people's names and faces
- Brushing up on geography
- Mastering long poems
- Even practicing guitar chords and much more!
